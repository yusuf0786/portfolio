			<p>Hi, I’m Yusuf. I'm a multi-talented human with over 1+ years of experiences in wide range of design & development disciplines.</p>
			<p>You can also call me a front end web developer, UI UX developer or by any other market defined function-title. I'm also a multi-disciplinary maker with over 5 years of experiences in wide range of design disciplines, entrepreneur, front-end developer, traveler, photographer and more.</p>
			<p>I don’t like to define myself by the work I’ve done. I define myself by the work I want to do. Skills can be taught, personality is inherent. I prefer to keep learning, continue challenging myself, and do interesting things that matter.</p>
			<p>Fueled by high energy levels and boundless enthusiasm, I’m easily inspired and more then willing to follow my fascinations wherever they take me. I’m passionate, expressive, multi-talented spirit with a natural ability to entertain and inspire. I’m never satisfied to just come up with ideas. Instead I have an almost impulsive need to act on them.</p>
			<p>My abundant energy fuels me in the pursuit of many interests, hobbies, areas of study and artistic endeavors. I’m a fast learner, able to pick up new skills and juggle different projects and roles with relative ease.</p>
			<p>I like to develop expertise in a number of areas over the course of my life and career. My personality type is <a href="http://www.personalitypage.com/ENTJ.html">ENTJ</a>. I currently work remotely with a selected freelance client base and are open for new opportunities.</p>
			<p>ou can read more about my biography, experience, skills, education and much more in the file attached bellow:</p>
